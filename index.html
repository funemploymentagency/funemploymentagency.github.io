              <div class="details-body">
                This is for you if you are a high-performing professional who
                can afford time off but do not trust unstructured time. You
                likely have a strong resume and real runway but when external
                structure disappears you do not want to drift or scramble. You
                are not looking for sympathy or a safety net. You want
                reintegration infrastructure that gives you cadence
                accountability and a credible story you can stand behind. This
                is a strong fit if you work in network-driven industries like
                tech, consulting, media, or agencies and you live in cities
                where professional identity is social identity.

                This is not conventional insurance. The public-facing structure
                is membership coverage with underwritten eligibility and
                participation-verified benefits. Regulatory packaging, if any,
                will be explicit and jurisdiction-specific.

                Once we have a critical mass of Founding Cohort applications and
                can complete underwriting reviews. Expect invitations to review
                calls in late 2026, with cohort launch shortly thereafter.

              <summary>Why does this exist?</summary>
              <div class="details-body">
                Because the current system treats a career break as either a
                private failure or a bureaucratic problem. We think it should be
                a supported transition. Funemployment Agency is built for people
                who want to step away (or get pushed out) without losing
                dignity, structure, or momentum by combining real benefits with
                real reintegration infrastructure, verified through
                participation instead of paperwork.

              <div class="details-body">
                They make coverage fairer and benefits easier to access. Instead
                of forcing you to prove your situation with endless paperwork,
                Enkidu uses verified participation in real-world trust events to
                confirm identity and follow-through. That means faster
                approvals, fewer invasive checks, and better terms for members
                who show up consistently. It also reduces fraud which helps keep
                pricing stable and protects the integrity of the cohort.
